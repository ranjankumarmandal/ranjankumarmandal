### Hi there!
I'm Ranjan Kumar Mandal. I work as a software engineer at Sling Media (Dish Network). In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours before / after work).

Most of my open-source 🚀 projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - to help people learn 📚. You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java and get prepared for technical skills, or to learn full stack development specially when it comes to -
- Frontend - JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, RxJS, HTML5, CSS3, frontend libraries, frameworks 
- Backend - Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate 
- Database - MongoDB, MySql
- Cloud - aws, firebase, etc.

I also write 📝 articles about life, web-development and machine learning.

Thanks!
