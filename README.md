### Hi there!
I'm Ranjan Kumar Mandal. I work as a software engineer at Sling Media (Dish Network). In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours before / after work).

Most of my open-source 🚀 projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - to help people learn 📚. You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java and get prepared for technical skills, or to learn full stack development specially when it comes to Frontend - JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, RxJS, HTML5, CSS3, frontend libraries, frameworks, backend - Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate, DB - MongoDB, MySql, cloud - aws, firebase, etc.

I also write 📝 articles about life, web-development and machine learning.

Thanks!
