### Hi there!
I'm Ranjan Kumar Mandal. I work as a software engineer at Sling Media (Dish Network). In my spare time I do open-sourcing.

Most of my open-source 🚀 projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - to help people learn 📚 and learn along the way. You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java and get prepared for technical skills, or to learn full stack development specially when it comes to -
- Frontend - JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, RxJS, HTML5, CSS3, frontend libraries, frameworks 
- Backend - Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate 
- Database - MongoDB, MySql
- Cloud - AWS, Firebase
- System Design (LLD, HLD), etc.

I also write 📝 articles and love to talk about life, web-development and machine learning.

Thanks!
